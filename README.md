# üß† NeuroCut

NeuroCut is a powerful, AI-driven web platform designed to automatically remove image backgrounds with high precision using a pretrained U¬≤-Net deep learning model. Leveraging advanced semantic segmentation techniques, NeuroCut is capable of isolating complex foreground subjects such as hair, shadows, and fine textures with pixel-level accuracy.

The platform is built on a robust and scalable architecture that includes a modern FastAPI backend for handling inference requests and a highly responsive Vue 3 frontend styled with Tailwind CSS. It is engineered not only to remove backgrounds in real-time but also to enable users to customize their images with solid colors, gradients, and a wide selection of backgrounds from a built-in gallery.

NeuroCut is suitable for a wide range of users, including digital designers, photographers, content creators, online sellers, and studios. It significantly reduces the manual workload involved in image editing, allowing users to achieve professional-quality results with minimal effort. Whether for product photography, social media content, or personal branding, NeuroCut provides a streamlined, privacy-respecting, and visually impactful image editing experience.
